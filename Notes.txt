Project Structure
==================

/src/index.html
----------------
For your app to function, Ionic looks for the <ion-app> tag in your HTML

build/main.js 
-------------
is a concatenated file containing Ionic, Angular and your app’s JavaScript.

./src/
-------
contains uncompiled code, where most of the work for an Ionic app.

When we run ionic serve, our code inside of src/ is transpiled into the correct Javascript version that the browser understands (currently, ES5). That means we can work at a higher level using TypeScript, but compile down to the older form of Javascript the browser needs.

src/app/app.module.ts
----------------------
This is the entry point for our app.

This is a root module that essentially controls the rest of the application.

In this module, we’re setting the root component to 'MyApp', in src/app/app.component.ts.

This is the first component that gets loaded in our app.

app.component.ts
----------------
we’re setting our template to src/app/app.html

src/app/app.html
-----------------
<ion-nav> component to act as the main content area.

“root” page for the ion-nav component. When ion-nav loads, the component referenced by the variable 'rootPage' will be the root page.

rootPage is set to TabsPage.TabsPage will be the first page loaded in the nav controller

tab.ts
-------
@Component({
  selector: 'page-hello-ionic',
  templateUrl: 'hello-ionic.html'
})

selector is useful in order to override the css

All pages have both a class, and an associated template that’s being compiled as well.

Creating Additional Pages
==========================
src/pages/list/list.ts
-----------------------
import {NavController, NavParams} from 'ionic-angular'; ==> //component used to navigation between the pages

Components
===========
Ionic apps are made of high-level building blocks called components. Components allow you to quickly construct an interface for your app.

Eg. Action Sheets, alerts, cards, etc,.

import { ActionSheetController } from 'ionic-angular'; ==> importing Action Sheets components

use

constructor(public actionSheetCtrl: ActionSheetController) {
	this.actionSheetCtrl.create({
      title: 'Modify your album'
    }).present();
}

==============================================================
main.ts (starting point) -> Bootstrap 'AppModule' => 
app.module.ts -> Import root as well as all component in app (mainly set the root component) =>
app.component.ts -> starting component of the app, set our app's first template
==============================================================


run chrome with disabled all security
------------------------------------
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
